									<p>Hi! We are three UVA students (Maxwell Berman, Nick Sarris, Peter Ahn) in
										CS4750 who want to provide a service that helps takes the work out of deciding
										on attending musical events. Here is what we aim to do:</p>

								<h3>Streamlining your decision.</h3>
								<p>Deciding which music concert or festival to attend can be laborious. There is just no easy way to know how many of your favorite artists are going to be playing at massive events unless you count them yourself.</p>
								<div class="row">
									<div class="row-6 row-12-mobilep">
										<h3>Utilizing up-to-date data on your favorite artists.</h3>
										<p>Our service utilizes the Spotify Web API to retrieve data on artists and their upcoming concerts.</p>
									</div>
									<div class="row-6 row-12-mobilep">
										<h3>We do the work for you.</h3>
										<p>Using FestivalPickr is as simple as entering some of your favorite artists. FestivalPickr will produce easily digestible information to help you decide which concert is the best for you.</p>
